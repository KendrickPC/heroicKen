The template I will be using to do this rewrite is the Heroic template from Bootstrap. It is available for free online at the following site: 

https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/heroic-features/

Before making any changes to my project, I first did an NPM install. The I installed GULP with a simple gulp command in the terminal. 

I then placed a favicon.ico logo for my website to get rid of the error message in my console.
